 I am a sophomore at the University of Hong Kong. I am currently working as a research assistant in [HKU NLP group](https://hkunlp.github.io/), guided by [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/). My main research interest is in Natural Language Processing. I am now working on code generation, large language model and their applications. The goal of my research is to build applicable and efficient conversational human assistants and general artificial intelligence based on large language models.
