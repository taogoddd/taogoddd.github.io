 I am a third-year undergraduate at the University of Hong Kong. I previously worked as a research assistant in [HKU NLP group](https://hkunlp.github.io/) guided by [Dr. Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/). I am now in Princeton University as an exchange student in 2024 spring and working with [Dr. Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/) in [Princeton NLP Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/). My main research interest is in natural language processing and reinforcement learning. More specifically, the goal of my research is to build an intellegent language agent that can interacts with various environments effectively and efficiently.
