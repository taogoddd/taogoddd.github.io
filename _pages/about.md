 I am an incoming PhD student at the University of Hong Kong, advised by [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/) in [XLANG Lab](https://xlang.ai/). Previously, I worked with [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/) in [Princeton NLP Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/) focusing on language agents in 2024. I was fortuntely mentored by [Shunyu Yao](https://ysymyth.github.io/) during my visiting to Princeton University. My main research interest is in natural language processing and reinforcement learning. More specifically, the goal of my research is to build an intellegent language agent that can interacts with various environments effectively and efficiently. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my work, have any questions or ideas to discuss with!
