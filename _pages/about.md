 I am a third-year undergraduate at the University of Hong Kong. I am now working with [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/) in [Princeton NLP Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/) focusing on language agents. Previously, I worked as a research assistant in [HKU NLP group](https://hkunlp.github.io/) guided by [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/). My main research interest is in natural language processing and reinforcement learning. More specifically, the goal of my research is to build an intellegent language agent that can interacts with various environments effectively and efficiently. Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my work, have any questions or ideas to discuss with!
