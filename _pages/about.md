 I am a first-year PhD student at the University of Hong Kong, advised by [Tao Yu](https://taoyds.github.io/) in [XLANG Lab](https://xlang.ai/). Previously, I worked with [Karthik Narasimhan](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~karthikn/) in [Princeton NLP Group](https://princeton-nlp.github.io/) focusing on language agents in 2024. I was fortuntely mentored by [Shunyu Yao](https://ysymyth.github.io/) during my visiting to Princeton University. The goal of my research is to build an intelligent language agent that can interact with various environments effectively and efficiently, including digital ones (web, computer, etc.) and physical ones (real world robotics control, etc.). Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in my work, have any questions or ideas to discuss with!
